## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in [Department of CSE, IIT Bombay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/), working with [Prof. Sunita Sarawagi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sunita/). I work on the problem of Forecasting in Time-series and Point Processes. I am also exploring the problem of answering various queries in the forecast range of a sequence.

I have worked on Local Adaptation Models in Time-series Forecasting. Visit our work on [Adaptive Recurrent Units (ARU)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3292500.3330996) ([arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09926)) to know more.

<!-- Prior to joining IITB, I was M.S. scholar in the [CSE, IIT Madras](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/).  For my M.S. thesis, I have worked with [Prof. B. Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) in the area of Social Network Analysis, on the problem of community detection in large networks. -->
