## Welcome to My Homepage

I am a forth year Ph.D. student in [CSE, IIT Bombay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/), working with [Prof. Sunita Sarawagi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sunita/).
Prior to joining IITB, I was M.S. scholar in the [CSE, IIT Madras](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/).  For my M.S. thesis, I have worked with [Prof. B. Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) in the area of Social Network Analysis, on the problem of community detection in large networks.
